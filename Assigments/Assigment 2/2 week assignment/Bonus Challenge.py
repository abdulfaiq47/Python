"""Bonus Challenge:
Write a program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using for loop.
Hint: First 10 Fibanacci numbers are ïƒ  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34

"""
# What is the Fibonacci Sequence?
# It's a series where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers:
# (0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, etc.)

a=0 # start with 0
b=1 # start with 1
for i in range(10): 
    print(a )# print o
    c=a # store the value of a in c which is '0'
    a=b # then store the value of a in b which is '0'
    b=c+b # then add 0 + 1 then repeat automatically a =1 then agin a=2 and so on .
